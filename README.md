PSCreateUser
============

Helps me to create AD Users more efficient.

When we create AD Users there are different processes we walk through:
* Are there special schemes for Usernames?
* What's with profile folder, Networkdrives, ACLs?
* Which is the right OU for my new user?
* Do we have to create datasets in other databases?

The most of this cases are dependencies that we can go through programmatic.
Give me name, department, position and I will create User ID, Homedrive and group affiliation.
Also I will find gaps in your User ID scheme and orphaned user accounts.
